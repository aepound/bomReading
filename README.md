# bomReading
Produces a Book of Mormon reading chart using LaTeX and Matlab.

The idea of this project is that you can run the matlab script,
and if you also have LaTeX on your machine, then a pdf will be 
produced which has all the book of the Book of Mormon output along
with a listing of every verse also.  

My kids love to read the BOM and mark off which verses they have 
read.
